/**
 * A piecewise-linear target a refined triangulation should follow: a guide mesh over the same plane,
 * carrying one or more 2D fields at its vertices, linear across each of its triangles.  Refinement
 * inserts guide vertices where the triangulation's own linear interpolation of a field strays from the
 * guide by more than a tolerance, so wherever the guide bends the triangulation gains the vertex that
 * holds the bend - at the guide vertex's exact Float point.
 *
 * Each field has a scale: how many of its units one unit of the plane stands for (see [areaScaleOf]),
 * so an error in field units divided by it reads in the plane's units and one tolerance serves fields of
 * any kind.  Inside the guide a field is the guide's own interpolation; outside it, the nearest
 * triangle's linear map carries on.
 *
 * A plain class: it holds arrays.
 *
 * @property FloatArray        points      The guide's vertices in the plane, x0, y0, ...
 * @property IntArray          triangles   Three vertex indices per guide triangle.
 * @property List<FloatArray>  fields      Each field's 2D value per guide vertex, x0, y0, ...
 * @property DoubleArray       fieldScales Each field's units per unit of the plane (positive).
 * @property IntArray          candidates  The guide vertices refinement may insert, ascending.
